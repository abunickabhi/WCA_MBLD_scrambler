## WCA MBLD scrambler
This project is my personal dream to make scrambler that makes it easier to practice big MBLD attempts at home and less time is spent scrambling the cubes for the attempt, arranging the cubes for the attempt.

The process this robot does is that:
Puts the cubes on conveyor belt
all gets scrambled, and stacked in square formation
Scramble pacing is 60 cube in ~3 minutes
Different 3x3s can be used, scrambling mechanism should be able to scramble accurately for different tension cube

## WCA all puzzle scrambler
I plan to make a simple robot to make Tnoodle scramblers for all puzzles including pyraminx, 6x6, 7x7, sq-1 and the other WCA puzzles.
We now know that 2x2, 3x3, bigcubes and clock can be successfully moved/turned/scrambled. A  square-1 scrambler does not exists, it sounds to be super fun to build it as the puzzle shapeshifts so the scrambling bot also has to adjust more.

## Mosaic handler
One more commericial spin-off of this product is to have fast mosaic solvers(solving cubes after mosaic display is over) or mosaic makers (solved cube to mosaic front face).I think this is where most of sales of this robot would be rather than first two categories.

## WCA MBLD scrambler

The process this robot does is that:
put cubes on conveyor belt
all gets scrambled, and stacked in square formation
speed should be 60 cube scrambling in 3 minutes
Different 3x3s can be used, scrambling mechanism should be able to scramble accurately for different tension cube

## WCA all puzzle scrambler
In this product I make a simple robot to make Tnoodle scramblers for all puzzles including pyraminx, 6x6x, 7x7, sq-1 and the other WCA puzzles.
We now know that 2x2, 3x3, bigcubes and clock can be successfully moved/turned/scrambled. A  square-1 scrambler does not exists, i would be super fun to build it as the puzzle shapeshifts.

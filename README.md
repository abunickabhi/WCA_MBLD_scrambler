# WCA_allpuzzle_scrambler
Using a simple non-lego robot to make Tnoodle scramblers for all puzzles including pyraminx , 6x6x, 7x7, sq-1 and the other WCA puzzles.

We now know that 2x2, 3x3, bigcubes and clock can be successfully moved/turned/scrambled.

I still do not know if a  sq-1 scrambler exists. It would be super hard to build as the puzzle shapeshifts.
